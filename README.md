# URL-Check

This script was created using the Python programming language which aims to detect suspicious payloads from a URL. The way this script works is by checking the URL and then comparing it with a txt file containing "XSS" and "SQL injection" payload samples, so that the more payload samples that are included in the txt file, the higher the detection level.

How to :

1. make sure the python script and text file in one directory
